# Machine-Translation-Paper-Presentation

- author: pretend you are the main author of the paper, talk about the results, problem definition, experimental findings
- scientific reviewer: you must make a critical evaluation of the paper, not necessarily negative; read the guidelines for NIPS
- engineer: implement something related to the paper either on the same dataset or on a new one; prepare to share the code and some empirical intuition behind the paper.
- visionary: propose a follow-up research project or a new application; take into account the previous work and existing work being done; take into account ethics and the socio-economic impact
